## About

**Topological Memory Explorer** is an **interactive scientific thought experiment** that explores one of the deepest mysteries in modern cosmology:

> **Why does the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) show a mysterious power deficit at large angular scales (low-ℓ)?**

This tool bridges **established science** (finite topology cosmology) with a **speculative origin story**:  
**Could the geometry of our universe be an inherited "mold" from a preceding universe?**

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Interactive CMB Power Spectrum** | Toggle between ΛCDM prediction and Planck observations with real acoustic peak at ℓ ≈ 220 |
| **Topology Size Slider** | Adjust the "inherited" cosmic size and see how it suppresses low-ℓ modes |
| **Visual Mechanism Flow** | Step-by-step concept map from pre-universe collapse to CMB imprint |
| **Falsifiability Table** | Clear predictions testable by CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and Euclid |
| **Scientific Integrity Badges** | Distinguishes **established science** from **speculative hypothesis** |

## Scientific Foundation

### Established Science (✓ Verified)
- **Low-ℓ power deficit** confirmed by Planck 2018
- **Finite topology cosmology** (Torus, Dodecahedral, Lens spaces) predicts low-ℓ cutoff
- **Circles in the Sky** search method widely used

### Speculative Hypothesis (Thought Experiment)
- **"Topological Memory"**: Pre-universe topology frozen into inflationary vacuum, inherited by our universe
- **No known physical mechanism** — this is **philosophy of initial conditions**

> **This is not a scientific theory. It is a question.**

## Interactive Demo

Try it now:  
[https://snowbellsan.github.io/topological-memory](https://snowbellsan.github.io/topological-memory)

1. **Section I**: See the real CMB anomaly (ℓ=2,3 power ~20% of prediction)
2. **Section III**: Drag the **Topology Size** slider
   - Smaller size → stronger low-ℓ suppression
   - Observe ℓ_cutoff = π / (size × 0.01)
3. **Section IV**: Learn how CMB-S4 (2030s) can **falsify** this idea

## Falsifiability (The Blade of Science)

| Prediction | Test | Falsification Condition |
|----------|------|-------------------------|
| Repeating patterns in CMB | Circles in the Sky | No matched circles |
| Sharp cutoff at specific ℓ | High-precision Cℓ | Smooth power spectrum |
| Symmetry axes | Anisotropy analysis | Isotropic distribution |

> **If CMB-S4 finds no topological signatures, this hypothesis dies. That is the point.**
